# dac
Data-as-code

## Intro

As technology transitions into the world of Web 3.0, the way in which data is understood will evolve.  This
package hopes to serve as a demo to how data can be manipulated in a more robust way.  Many of the ideas
can be seen in IaC (Infrastructure-as-code) and similar applications.

## Installation / Dev Environment

The main package lives inside of the `/dac` folder.  There is a local test environment setup in Docker for
reprocibility and ease of use.
